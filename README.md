This project was created for SNU HackData 2.0 2018. The motive behind the project was to create a decentralized emergency services 
providing system which could connect the needy directly to the nearest authority concerned with a particular type of emergencies, viz.,
fire, police or ambulance.

This project was realized using the Telegram bot API for Python.
